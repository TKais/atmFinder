#Technologies Used#

#####JavaScript#####
#####jQuery#####
#####HTML#####
#####CSS#####
#####Handlebars#####
#####Google Maps API#####
#####Chase API#####
#####Browser Geolocation#####

#Why these Technologies?#
#####I love JavaScript through and through, from the front-end to the back-end (which is why I mainly used vanilla JavaScript and Node.js)#####
#####Handlebars was a quick way to format data from the Chase API with HTML elements#####
#####Using a server was the best way around the ajax cross-domain issue. I thought about using a front-end framework like Angular.js for the $http variable, but the Angular docs said it only supports the browser's XMLHttpRequest object or JSONP (neither worked for me using just ajax -- all docs pointed to using a server to handle the request)#####

#What would you have changed if you had more time?#
#####Would have used a CSS pre-processor like Sass or Less.js#####
#####Would have designed the map to be responsive#####
#####Would have styled the page more#####
